# shell define thingy


### problem 1 ###
# quotes are important so that find is passed the entire expression vs
# the wildcard generating for the level the command is called from

find . -name '*.tex'

# My output:
# ./tex_test/level_1_f2.tex
# ./tex_test/level_1_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_alt/level_alt_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_2/level_2_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_2/tex_test_3/level_3_f1.tex

### problem 2 ###

grep -w -n tomato tom1.txt tom2.txt tom3.txt tom4.txt

# My output:
# tom1.txt:2:I could have eaten tomato after tomato, but alas that course only had three.
# tom2.txt:3:this line contains tomato but the next contains "Tomato", maybe you see it, maybe you don't
# tom4.txt:3:tomato
