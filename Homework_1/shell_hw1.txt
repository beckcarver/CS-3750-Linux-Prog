# (not a script for turn in) ! /bin/sh

### PROBLEM 1 ###
# quotes are important so that find is passed the entire expression vs
# the wildcard only generating for the level the command is called from

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 1
find . -name '*.tex'

# My output:
# ./tex_test/level_1_f2.tex
# ./tex_test/level_1_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_alt/level_alt_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_2/level_2_f1.tex
# ./tex_test/tex_test_2/tex_test_3/level_3_f1.tex

### PROBLEM 2 ###
# you could also do grep -w -n tomato `find . -name "*.txt*"`# where the ``(back quote) 
# run find before the command is executed and places its output in the command

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 2
grep -w -n tomato tom1.txt tom2.txt tom3.txt tom4.txt

# My output:
# tom1.txt:2:I could have eaten tomato after tomato, but alas that course only had three.
# tom2.txt:3:this line contains tomato but the next contains "Tomato", maybe you see it, maybe you don't
# tom4.txt:3:tomato

### PROBLEM 3 ###
# again i could use  grep -w -v pepper `find . -name "*.txt"`  instead of writing the names, but as requested
# my command is below

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 3
grep -w -v pepper tom1.txt tom2.txt tom3.txt tom4.txt | wc -l

# My output:
# 15

### PROBLEM 4 ###
# hey look, I accidentally solved this ahead of time in problem 2, unix shell is actually fun
# my solution doesn't use -exec though, I hope that's okay

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 4
grep -w Grade `find . -name "*.txt*"`

# My output:
# ./grade_2.txt:this line has Grade, but the next has 'Grade', do you see it?
# ./grade_2.txt:'Grade'
# ./grade_1.txt:this line has grade in it but the next has 'Grade' do you see it?
# ./grade_1.txt:see, im Grade
# ./tom3.txt:this tom3 file also has the word Grade

### PROBLEM 5 ###
# I believe here again you could use `find ...` instead of typing names manually

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 5
cat tr1.txt tr2.txt tr3.txt | tr [A-Z] [a-z]

# My output:
# help this is stuck in all caps
# and this was already lowercase
# this has alternating case
# this has a single capital letter 'g' and everything else is lowercase

### PROBLEM 6 ###

echo ~~~~~~~~~~ problem 6
