check options:
if less than 3 arguments, end
if c and no x, then continue
or if x and no c, then continue
	if neither above are true end

look for f in the somewhere in the first 4 elements
	store that position of f if found
	if not found end

using flags and position of f call:
	create archive for -c
	extract archive for -x


for create archive,
	identify type and create its header
		store data after header
	repeat unitl end of files given
		store null blocks

for extract
	identify type read
		create a file and extract
		position files according to type and other info
	when we can no longer read any more bytes
	or null blocks are found
		end
