define function intoOut
    read from standard input
    write to standard output

if no arguments (argc is 0)
	call intoOut

otherwise for each argument (argv[])
    using READ ONLY (O_RDONLY)
    IF current argument is '-'
        call intoOut 
    IF-ELSE open current argument AND no errors
        read all files into buffer (using fread, 4096 bytes)
        read standard input
        write to standard output (using fwrite())
    ELSE
        print that argument was invalid or file was unreadable

close all files
