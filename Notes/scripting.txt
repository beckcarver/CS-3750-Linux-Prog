#-------------#
single or double quotes pass an expression as a whole instead of running that expression

such as:
find . -name *.c
vs.
find . -name "*.c"

now find will run the *.c wildcard on every instance, vs. doing it only on command call
#-------------#


#-------------#
back quotes `` run an expression before running the calling command

wc -l find . -name "*.c"
wc -l `find . -name "*.c"`

the first creates a syntax error, you cant call a wordcount on a find,
the second runs find, and returns a list of files that wordcount then operateso on
